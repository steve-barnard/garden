##################################### STEPS #####################################
"""
Brief notes on steps (see docs for more detail):

    - any python callable can be made into a step by decorating it with `@step`.
    - the callable MUST have valid type-hints for all arguments and return type.
    - these type-hints are used to verify that the steps can be composed in a pipeline.
    - steps also extract metadata from the callable, like `description` or
        `output_info` from the callable's docstring or return annotation,
        respectively.
    - "specialized steps" like `@run_inference` are the best way to fetch a model
        from our model registry for use in a pipeline.
    - don't use `Any` or `None` in step annotations. If a step is indeed general enough to
        accept or return any python object, prefer `object` as the annotation.
